    description: `I work for a popular e-learning platform based out of South-East Asia. We needed to expose certain business functions via REST APIs to other developers and customers. I reached out to RegelCloud to build a serverless solution for this using AWS API Gateway and Lambda functions (NodeJS) manipulating our MS SQL Server data (in RDS). I was deeply impressed with how proficiently they designed and executed the solution. From ensuring best practices like using the AWS Parameter Store for storing encrypted secrets safely, using the Serverless Framework for automation and CI-CD, to publishing the final OpenAPI spec on Swagger Hub - everything was efficiently executed with great care. Our whole engagement was a great success - and I am already looking forward to renewing our contract with RegelCloud - our trusted dev partners!`,
